Name: Emma Belnap

I am interested in your project proposal because I love applications that help with organization. I have some experience with SQLite and I worked with Vue at my job last summer. I am happy to help with any part of the project. 

Business:
I really like the idea of having a free and paid version. The free account offers useful features, but the paid account might need to offer more benefits to be worth the price (if we have time to implement) such as the ability to add a color coded system to distinguish different types of tasks.

Legal:
I agree that LLC seems like the best option for this project.

Technical:
I agree that 3 tables (a user, auth, and task data table) should be enough to organize all the data.

I would love to work on this project, so let me know!
