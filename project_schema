Table Descriptions
The user table will be used when a user creates an account, they provide this information which gets
stored in the database.
The authentication table is used to store user credentials, it contains a userID as the primary key and can
be linked to the user information through the username foreign key.
The event table will be used to store events that are stored in the users calendar and is connected to its
corresponding user the username foreign key.
The calendar table will be used to store calendar dates, this will be pulled to create the calendar
interface by knowing what day of the week the month starts on and showing how many days the month
will have along with getting a date format to store in the eventid
Columns
Most of the column names are intuitive, except the bold column in the event table. This will be a
Boolean that users can set to have their event considered important, making it highlighted on their
calendar.
The eventID, userID, and dateID are internal object identifiers and will not be visible to the user. The
dateID will be a number incrementing from the start of the application.
Normalization
The database is in first normal form because it is separated into tables containing related data and each
table has a related primary key.
